<h1>PUMPERNICKLE IS GALLOPING THROUGH THE DESERT!</h1> 
<p>He is a <strong>very</strong> beautiful horse who was born in the 
    <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Desert>desert</a>, but as a young colt,
he was captured by some men who saw him and wanted him for themselves. He had to go through many
trials and tribulations before he finally escaped and made it back to the desert where he could
live out the rest of his days, beautiful, wild and <em>free</em>. </p>
